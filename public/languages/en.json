There I learned electronics, mechanics, project development, critical thinking, and most importantly, my first programming languages: <span>QBasic</span>, <span>PLC programming</span>, and working with <span>CNC lathes</span>. It was then that I knew for sure I wanted to become a programmer.",
        "third-description": "Today, as an <span>Electromechanical Technician</span>, I channel that same curiosity through programming. I enjoy identifying problems, finding practical solutions, and automating tasks. I currently work at Thinkion as a <span>Customer Service Analyst</span>, where I combine technical support with testing and development to improve user experience and system stability.",
